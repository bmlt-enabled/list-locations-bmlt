To contribute to List Locations BMLT, fork, make your changes and send a pull request to the master branch.

Take a look at the issues for bugs that you might be able to help fix.

Once your pull request is merged it will be released in the next version.

We are using [https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bmlt-wordpress-deploy](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bmlt-wordpress-deploy) to deploy the plugin to SVN. This is done automatically upon tagging a release. If you wish to tag a release for testing or a beta release make sure the tag name contains the word beta in it as the deployment to wordpress will be cancelled. For ex. `3.9.6-beta`

To get things going in your local environment.

`docker-compose up`

Get your wordpress installation going.  Remember your admin password.  Once it's up, login to admin and activate the "List Locations BMLT" plugin.

Now you can make edits to the list-locations.php file and it will instantly take effect.

Please make note of the .editorconfig file and adhere to it as this will minimise the amount of formatting errors.  If you are using PHPStorm you will need to install the EditorConfig plugin.
