== Description ==

List Locations BMLT is a plugin that returns all unique towns or counties from your BMLT server for a given service body on your site.

SHORTCODE
Basic: [list_locations]
Attributes: root_server, services, recursive, state, delimiter, list, state_skip, city_skip

-- Shortcode parameters can be combined

== Usage ==

A minimum of root_server and services attribute are required, which would return all towns for that service body seperated by a comma.

Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50&quot;]

**Recursive:** to recurse service bodies add recursive=&quot;1&quot;
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50&quot; recursive=&quot;1&quot;]

**State:** to remove appending of the state add state=&quot;0&quot;
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50&quot; state=&quot;0&quot;]

**State Skip:** to skip the inclusion of a state when using state=&quot;1&quot; add state_skip=&quot;NC&quot;
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50&quot; state=&quot;1&quot; state_skip=&quot;NC&quot;]

**City Skip** To skip the inclusion of a city add city_skip=&quot;Indianapolis&quot;. This can be useful when mentioning a city out of order or in a different part of the text.
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50&quot; state=&quot;1&quot; city_skip=&quot;Indianapolis&quot;]

**Services:** to add multiple service bodies just seperate by a comma.
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; services=&quot;50,37,26&quot;]

**Delimiter:** to change the delimiter to something besides a comma I would add delimiter=&quot; - &quot; or to create newlines between each I could do this delimiter=&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, or delimiter=&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; delimiter=&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;]

**List:** You can list by the following town, county, borough, neighborhood. The default is town.
Ex. [list_locations root_server=&quot;https://www.domain.org/main_server&quot; list=&quot;town&quot;]
